Stepping into this new chapter feels like dipping my toes into a river of possibility, unsure of where the current will take me but eager to dive in nonetheless. <br> The city skyline becomes a canvas for my aspirations, each building a testament to the stories waiting to unfold within its walls.
<br>
As I navigate the bustling streets, I find myself in a whirlwind of new experiences - from study sessions to late night walks with newfound friends. Every corner holds the promise of discovery, every encounter a chance to learn and grow.
<br>
In this city of strangers turned friends, I find memories that will last for a lifetime.
<br><br>
